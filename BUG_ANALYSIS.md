# MedEdBot Bug Analysis

## Current Known Issues

### 1. Health Check Timeouts After 4 Hours
**Status**: Fixed
**Severity**: High
**Description**: Container stopped working after 4 hours due to health check timeout (30s).

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Unlimited thread creation in logging operations causing resource exhaustion
- Rate limiter memory accumulation without cleanup
- Session cleanup blocking the main thread
- Health check endpoint using `/` instead of dedicated lightweight endpoint

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created dedicated `/health` endpoint with minimal overhead
- Implemented bounded ThreadPoolExecutor (5 workers) for logging operations
- Added rate limiter memory cleanup (runs every hour, removes entries older than 2 hours)
- Made session cleanup async to prevent blocking
- Optimized health check configuration:
  - Interval: 45s → 60s (Synology), timeout: 30s → 20s
  - Using `/health` endpoint instead of `/`
  - Better retry configuration (3 retries with longer start period)

**Performance Optimization Discovery**:
- Logging and disk I/O operations add significant overhead on NAS devices
- CPU and RAM performance is excellent when I/O is minimized
- Configurable logging now available via `CONTAINER_LOGGING` environment variable

### 2. Session Cleanup Memory Management
**Status**: Resolved
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Sessions were not being properly cleaned up, leading to memory growth over time.

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented automatic session expiry after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Added periodic cleanup task
- Sessions now properly release resources on cleanup

### 3. Audio File Handling in Ephemeral Environments
**Status**: Resolved
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Audio files were failing to save in cloud environments without persistent storage.

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented adaptive storage strategy
- Memory storage with base64 encoding for ephemeral environments
- Automatic detection of storage capabilities

### 4. Concurrent Request Queue Overflow
**Status**: Monitoring
**Severity**: Low
**Description**: Under extreme load, message queues for individual users could grow unbounded.

**Current Mitigation**:
- Queue size limit of 10 messages per user
- Rejection of new messages when queue is full
- Warning messages to users about system load

### 5. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
**Status**: Resolved
**Severity**: High
**Description**: Under high load, database connections were being exhausted.

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Increased pool size and added recycling
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    pool_size=20,
    max_overflow=40,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_recycle=3600
)
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Environment Variables in Repository
**Status**: Critical - Requires User Action
**Severity**: Critical
**Description**: If .env file with actual credentials is committed to repository, it poses a severe security risk.

**Required Actions**:
1. Never commit .env files with real credentials
2. Use .env.template for examples
3. Rotate all credentials if exposed
4. Use secret management services in production

### 2. Input Validation Hardening
**Status**: Implemented
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Additional input validation was needed to prevent injection attacks.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Length limits on all user inputs
- Pattern matching for malicious content
- Proper encoding validation
- Email address validation strengthened

### 3. Rate Limiting Implementation
**Status**: Implemented
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Added rate limiting to prevent abuse.

**Implementation**:
- 30 requests per minute per user
- Burst allowance of 5 requests
- Graceful degradation messages

## Performance Issues

### 1. Gemini API Response Times
**Status**: Optimized
**Severity**: Low
**Description**: Some Gemini API calls were taking longer than expected.

**Optimizations**:
- Implemented timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Parallel API calls where possible
- Response caching for common queries

### 2. TTS Generation Latency
**Status**: Acceptable
**Severity**: Low
**Description**: Text-to-speech generation adds 2-5 seconds to response time.

**Current State**:
- This is API-limited and acceptable
- Users are notified about audio generation
- Async processing prevents blocking

### 3. Database Query Performance
**Status**: Optimized
**Severity**: Low
**Description**: Some queries were slow without proper indexes.

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_id ON conversation_logs(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_timestamp ON conversation_logs(timestamp);
```

## Stability Issues

### 1. Memory Leaks in Long-Running Sessions
**Status**: Resolved
**Severity**: High
**Description**: Memory usage grew over time due to session accumulation.

**Fix Applied**:
- Automatic session expiry
- Proper cleanup of resources
- Garbage collection hints
- Memory monitoring alerts

### 2. Uncaught Exception Handling
**Status**: Resolved
**Severity**: Medium
**Description**: Some edge cases caused unhandled exceptions.

**Fix Applied**:
- Global exception handlers
- Graceful error messages to users
- Comprehensive logging of errors
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

## Future Improvements

### 1. Distributed Session Storage
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Move sessions to Redis for horizontal scaling
**Benefits**:
- Better scalability
- Session persistence across restarts
- Distributed locking support

### 2. Message Queue Implementation
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: Use RabbitMQ or Redis for message queuing
**Benefits**:
- Better handling of bursts
- Reliable message delivery
- Priority message support

### 3. Observability Enhancements
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Implement comprehensive monitoring
**Components**:
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- Distributed tracing
- Alert management

### 4. Automated Testing Suite
**Priority**: High
**Description**: Comprehensive test coverage
**Components**:
- Unit tests for all handlers
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Load testing scenarios
- Chaos engineering tests

## Bug Reporting

For new bug reports, please include:

1. **Environment**: Cloud/NAS/Local
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Exact sequence of actions
3. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
4. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
5. **Logs**: Relevant error messages or logs
6. **Frequency**: How often it occurs

## Monitoring Checklist

Daily monitoring should include:

- [ ] Active session count
- [ ] Memory usage trends
- [ ] Database connection pool status

## Emergency Procedures

### High Memory Usage
1. Check session count: `GET /health/sessions`
2. Force cleanup: `POST /admin/cleanup`
3. Restart container if needed

### Database Connection Exhaustion
1. Check pool status: `GET /health/database`
2. Kill idle connections
3. Restart with increased pool size

### API Rate Limits
1. Check Gemini API quota
2. Implement request caching
3. Notify users of degraded service

### System Overload
1. Enable maintenance mode
2. Increase rate limiting
3. Scale horizontally if possible
