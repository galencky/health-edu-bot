### 🚀 Ready for Deployment

The project is now clean and ready for deployment to Render or any Docker-compatible platform.

**Important**: Before deploying, ensure your `.env` file contains:
- `R2_ENDPOINT_URL`
- `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `R2_BUCKET_NAME`
- `R2_PUBLIC_URL` (should be https://galenchen.uk)

### 🔧 Recent Fixes
- Fixed `TTS_USE_DRIVE` import error in `services/tts_service.py`
- Added `boto3==1.34.0` to `requirements.txt` for R2 storage support

### 📝 Pending Tasks
1. Run `python scripts/archive/fixes/simple_url_fix.py --live` to fix existing database URLs
2. Upload any missing files from local to R2
3. Deploy to production server
