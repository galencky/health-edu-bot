# Mededbot Security and Bug Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report details critical security vulnerabilities and bugs found in the Mededbot codebase. The analysis covers security, database operations, session management, file handling, error handling, and API security.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities (Severity: CRITICAL)

### 1. Hardcoded Secrets and API Keys in Version Control
**File:** `.env` (line 1-18)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Issue:** All sensitive credentials are exposed in the repository:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Exposed Google Gemini API key
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`: Exposed Gmail application password  
- `GOOGLE_CREDS_B64`: Base64 encoded service account credentials (contains private key)
- `LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET`: LINE Bot credentials
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string with password

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all integrated services. Attackers can:
- Use the Gemini API key to make calls at your expense
- Send emails from your Gmail account
- Access Google Drive with service account permissions
- Impersonate your LINE bot
- Access and modify database

**Fix Required:**
1. Immediately rotate ALL exposed credentials
2. Remove `.env` from version control
3. Use environment variables or secure secret management
4. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already present but file was committed before)

### 2. SQL Injection Vulnerability
**File:** `utils/database.py` (lines 119, 142, etc.)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:** While SQLAlchemy ORM is used which provides some protection, there are potential risks:
- No input validation on user_id, message, reply fields before database insertion
- Text fields are truncated but not sanitized
- Direct string interpolation in some logging statements

**Impact:** Potential for SQL injection if SQLAlchemy protections are bypassed

### 3. Email Header Injection Protection Insufficient
**File:** `handlers/logic_handler.py` (lines 318-339)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** While email validation was improved with bug fixes, the validation could be strengthened:
- Regex pattern allows some special characters that could be exploited
- No rate limiting on email sending
- No verification that user owns the email address

**Impact:** Potential for email spam, header injection attacks

## Database Operation Bugs (Severity: HIGH)

### 4. Connection Pool Exhaustion Risk
**File:** `utils/database.py` (lines 74-81)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:** 
- Async engine created with `pool_size=5, max_overflow=10` but no connection timeout
- No connection pool monitoring or cleanup
- Sync fallback creates new engine each time (line 252)

**Impact:** Database connection exhaustion under load

### 5. Transaction Handling Issues
**File:** `utils/database.py` (lines 96-105)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- Generic exception handling in transaction context
- No specific handling for connection timeouts or network issues
- Sync fallback doesn't properly handle async context

**Impact:** Potential data inconsistency, lost transactions

## Session Management Issues (Severity: HIGH)

### 6. Race Condition in Session Access
**File:** `handlers/session_manager.py` (lines 17-61, 82-143)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:**
- Async and sync session access use different locks (asyncio.Lock vs threading.Lock)
- No guarantee of atomicity when switching between async/sync contexts
- Session cleanup runs in background without proper synchronization

**Impact:** Data corruption, session hijacking, inconsistent state

### 7. Memory Leak in Session Storage
**File:** `handlers/session_manager.py`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- Sessions store large text content (zh_output, translated_output) without limits
- TTS queue can grow unbounded
- References list can accumulate without cleanup

**Impact:** Memory exhaustion over time

## File Operation Vulnerabilities (Severity: HIGH)

### 8. Path Traversal Risk (Partially Fixed)
**File:** `main.py` (line 56)
**Severity:** MEDIUM (was CRITICAL, now partially mitigated)
**Issue:**
- StaticFiles mount is properly restricted to TTS_AUDIO_DIR
- However, no validation on filenames when creating files
- Audio files saved with user-controlled filenames

**Impact:** Potential for directory traversal if filename validation is bypassed

### 9. File Resource Leaks
**File:** `handlers/line_handler.py` (lines 284-337)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- Complex file handling with multiple retry mechanisms
- File cleanup in finally block may fail silently
- Temporary files may accumulate if cleanup fails

**Impact:** Disk space exhaustion, information disclosure

### 10. Missing File Size Validation in Multiple Places
**File:** `services/tts_service.py`, `utils/google_drive_service.py`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- TTS service has text length limit but no output file size limit
- Google Drive upload has no file size validation
- Large files could exhaust disk space or API quotas

## Error Handling Issues (Severity: MEDIUM)

### 11. Unhandled Exceptions in Critical Paths
**File:** `routes/webhook.py` (lines 20-23)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- Generic exception handling returns 400 for all errors
- Stack trace printed to console (information disclosure)
- No specific handling for signature verification failures

### 12. Missing Error Context
**File:** `services/gemini_service.py` (lines 62-89)
**Severity:** LOW
**Issue:**
- Timeout errors don't include request context
- Retry mechanism doesn't log what's being retried
- No metrics on retry success/failure rates

### 13. Inadequate TTS Error Handling
**File:** `services/tts_service.py` (lines 96-108)
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- Multiple failure points without specific error messages
- Debug prints expose internal state
- No fallback for TTS failures

## FastAPI/Webhook Security Issues (Severity: MEDIUM)

### 14. Missing Security Headers
**File:** `main.py`
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- No CORS configuration
- Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- No rate limiting on endpoints
- No request size limits

### 15. Webhook Signature Verification Issues
**File:** `routes/webhook.py` (line 20)
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:**
- Signature verification happens inside try-except block
- Verification failures return generic 400 error
- No logging of verification failures
- No rate limiting for failed attempts

### 16. Insecure Direct Object Reference
**File:** `main.py` (line 67)
**Severity:** LOW
**Issue:**
- `/chat` endpoint uses hardcoded "test-user" ID
- No authentication or authorization
- Sessions can be accessed by anyone who knows the user ID

## Additional Security Concerns

### 17. Insufficient Input Validation
**Multiple files**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- No validation on disease names or topics in education mode
- Language names accepted without validation
- No sanitization of user messages before processing

### 18. Information Disclosure
**Multiple files**
**Severity:** LOW
**Issue:**
- Detailed error messages exposed to users
- Stack traces in logs
- Debug prints with sensitive information
- Model names and internal paths exposed

### 19. Missing Authentication
**All endpoints**
**Severity:** HIGH
**Issue:**
- No authentication on any endpoints except LINE webhook signature
- `/chat` endpoint publicly accessible
- No user verification beyond LINE user ID

### 20. Async/Sync Mixing Issues
**Multiple files**
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:**
- Mixing async and sync code without proper handling
- Calling sync functions from async context
- No proper event loop management
