# Housekeeping Summary

## Changes Made (July 30, 2025)

### üóÇÔ∏è Directory Reorganization

1. **Created New Directories:**
   - `docs/reports/` - For project reports and technical documentation
   - `scripts/deployment/` - For deployment-related scripts
   - `scripts/testing/` - For test utilities

2. **Files Moved:**
   - `BUG_REPORT.md` ‚Üí `docs/reports/`
   - `SECURITY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` ‚Üí `docs/reports/`
   - `SYSTEM_FLOWCHARTS.md` ‚Üí `docs/reports/`
   - `TECHNICAL_REPORT_PATENT.md` ‚Üí `docs/reports/`
   - `deploy-synology.sh` ‚Üí `scripts/deployment/`
   - `start-synology.sh` ‚Üí `scripts/deployment/`
   - `test-container.py` ‚Üí `scripts/testing/`

3. **Security Improvements:**
   - Removed `gitignore/` directory containing sensitive credentials
   - Archived `credentials.json` to `archive/google-drive-backup/` (no longer needed with R2 migration)

### ‚úÖ Files Kept in Root (Essential for Deployment)

- `main.py` - Application entry point
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- `render.yaml` - Render platform configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Standard Docker configuration
- `Dockerfile.synology` - Synology-specific Docker configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Standard Docker Compose
- `docker-compose.synology.yml` - Synology Docker Compose
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `.env` - Environment variables (not in git)

### üìù Script Updates

- Updated `scripts/deployment/deploy-synology.sh` to work from new location by:
  - Adding project root detection
  - Changing to project root before executing Docker commands

### üöÄ Deployment Impact

- **No breaking changes** - All deployment configurations remain functional
- Docker builds will work exactly as before
- Render deployment unaffected
- Synology deployment scripts now work from their new location

### üîê Security Notes

- Sensitive files have been properly secured
- Google Drive credentials archived (no longer needed with R2)
- All credentials should be in `.env` file or environment variables

## Running Deployment Scripts

From project root:
```bash
# Synology deployment
./scripts/deployment/deploy-synology.sh

# Or from anywhere
bash /path/to/project/scripts/deployment/deploy-synology.sh
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner root directory** - Only essential files remain
2. **Better organization** - Related files grouped together
3. **Improved security** - Sensitive files properly handled
4. **Easier navigation** - Clear directory structure
5. **Deployment ready** - All configurations work unchanged
