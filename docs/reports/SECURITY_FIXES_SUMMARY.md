# Critical Security Fixes Applied

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Scope:** Critical security vulnerabilities from BUG_REPORT.md

## Summary

All 4 critical security bugs have been successfully fixed. The application is now protected against the identified vulnerabilities.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Database Function Namespace Collision (utils/database.py)
**Fix:** Removed duplicate `get_db_session_sync()` function definition at lines 368-381.
- The correct implementation at line 137 is now the only definition
- Eliminated unpredictable behavior from function shadowing
- Prevents connection pool issues

### 2. ✅ Path Traversal Vulnerability (utils/memory_storage.py)
**Fix:** Added filename sanitization to all memory storage operations.
- Imported `sanitize_filename` from validators module
- Applied sanitization in `save()`, `get()`, `remove()`, and `exists()` methods
- Prevents directory traversal attacks (e.g., "../../etc/passwd")
- Invalid filenames are rejected with appropriate error messages

### 3. ✅ Memory Leak in Rate Limiter (utils/rate_limiter.py)
**Fix:** Implemented automatic cleanup to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- Added internal cleanup method `_cleanup_old_entries_internal()`
- Automatic cleanup triggers every 100 requests
- Removes keys older than 1 hour during automatic cleanup
- Manual cleanup still available via `cleanup_old_entries()` for 2+ hour old entries
- Prevents memory exhaustion under sustained load

### 4. ✅ Race Condition in Session Creation (handlers/session_manager.py)
**Fix:** Made session and lock creation atomic.
- Lock is now created before adding to dictionaries
- Fixed both `get_user_session()` and `reset_user_session()` functions
- Prevents duplicate lock objects for same user
- Eliminates potential for session data corruption

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Path Traversal:** Test with malicious filenames like "../../../etc/passwd"
2. **Rate Limiter:** Run load test with many unique IPs to verify automatic cleanup
3. **Session Race:** Use concurrent requests to verify atomic session creation
4. **Database:** Verify only one `get_db_session_sync()` function exists

## Next Steps

While critical security issues are resolved, consider addressing the remaining high and medium severity bugs from the full report to further improve system stability and security.
