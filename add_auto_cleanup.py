# === ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FOR CLEANUP CONFIGURATION ===

Add these to your .env file to enable cleanup:

# === File Cleanup Configuration ===
AUTO_CLEANUP_FILES=false          # true = immediate cleanup after upload
CLEANUP_AFTER_HOURS=24            # Hours to keep files (for delayed cleanup)
MAX_STORAGE_MB=500                # Maximum storage for audio files
ENABLE_SCHEDULED_CLEANUP=true     # Enable periodic cleanup task

# === Cleanup Strategy Options ===
# IMMEDIATE: Files deleted right after successful Drive upload
# DELAYED: Files kept for X hours then deleted
# SIZE_BASED: Keep newest files up to storage limit
# NONE: Keep all files (current behavior)

=== PROS & CONS OF AUTO-CLEANUP ===

‚úÖ PROS:
‚Ä¢ Saves local storage space
‚Ä¢ Prevents disk full issues
‚Ä¢ Automatic maintenance
‚Ä¢ Configurable retention policies

‚ùå CONS:
‚Ä¢ No local backup if Drive fails
‚Ä¢ Cannot re-serve files from local storage
‚Ä¢ TTS files need re-generation if requested again
‚Ä¢ Harder debugging without local files

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

üéØ For Production: Enable DELAYED cleanup (24-48 hours)
   - Keeps files temporarily for immediate serving
   - Automatic cleanup prevents storage issues
   
üîß For Development: Disable cleanup
   - Keep files for debugging
   - Manual cleanup when needed

üíæ For Limited Storage: Enable SIZE_BASED cleanup
   - Always keeps newest files
   - Automatic old file removal
